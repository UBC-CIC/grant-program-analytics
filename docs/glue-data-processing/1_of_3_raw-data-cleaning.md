### `course_info_mapping` <a name="course-info-mapping-detailed"></a>
```python
def course_info_mapping(df, column_list):
    course_info_pattern = re.compile(r'([A-Z]+\d+)([A-Z/]*)')
    for column_name in column_list:
        new_column_values = []
        for value_idx in range(len(list(df[column_name]))):
            this_course_info = ''.join(str(df[column_name].iloc[value_idx]).upper().split())
            course_info = re.findall(course_info_pattern, this_course_info)
            if course_info:
                course_code = course_info[0][0]
                suffix = course_info[0][1].strip('/')
                if suffix:
                    if '/' in suffix:
                        all_course_codes = []
                        detailed_codes = suffix.split('/')
                        for d_code in detailed_codes:
                            this_course_code = course_code + d_code
                            all_course_codes.append(course_info_formatting(this_course_code))
                        new_column_values.append(all_course_codes)
                        continue
                    else:
                        course_code += suffix
                course_code = course_info_formatting(course_code)
                new_column_values.append([course_code])
            else:
                new_column_values.append('')
        df['cleaned_'+column_name] = new_column_values
```
The `course_info_mapping` function systematically processes course information in a dataset to standardize course codes and their formats. This function is crucial for ensuring consistent data across records where course identifiers might vary in formatting or detail level.

#### Detailed Process Flow
1. **Regular Expression Setup**:
   - Defines a regular expression pattern to match typical course codes (e.g., "CS101") and optional suffixes (e.g., "A/B/C"), which may indicate different sections or semesters of the course.

2. **Iterate Over Columns**:
   - The function iterates over each column specified in `column_list`, applying the mapping logic to each. These columns are expected to contain course-related information.

3. **Process Each Entry**:
   - For each entry in the current column, it strips whitespace, converts to uppercase for standardization, and then applies the regular expression to find matches.
   - If matches are found, it further processes them to separate the base course code from any suffixes.

4. **Handle Suffixes**:
   - If suffixes are present, checks for multiple codes separated by slashes and handles them individually by appending them to the base course code and formatting each.
   - Appends all processed course codes to a list which is then set as the new value for that entry in the DataFrame.

5. **Store Processed Data**:
   - Creates a new column in the DataFrame with a prefix 'cleaned_' added to the original column name, storing the newly formatted course codes.

6. **Logging and Debugging**:
   - The function can be extended to log detailed processing information or to include debugging statements to trace the transformation of specific entries, facilitating maintenance and updates.

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**:
  - `df`: The pandas DataFrame containing the data to be processed.
  - `column_list`: A list of column names in the DataFrame that contain course information needing standardization.

- **Outputs**:
  - The function modifies the DataFrame `df` in-place, adding new columns for each processed column, containing the cleaned and standardized course information. No value is returned; the primary output is the modified DataFrame.

### `year_mapping` <a name="year-mapping-detailed"></a>
```python
def year_mapping(df, column_list, year_start=0, upto_future_year=5):
    today = datetime.date.today()
    this_year = int(str(today.year)[-2:]) + upto_future_year
    years = [str(j) if j>=10 else '0'+str(j) for j in range(year_start, this_year)]
    for column_name in column_list:
        new_column_values = []
        for value_idx in range(len(list(df[column_name]))):
            mentioned_years = []
            this_year_data = str(df[column_name].iloc[value_idx])
            if this_year_data == '20245/2025':  # Exception handling for specific known data errors
                new_column_values.append('')
                continue
            this_year_data = process_colon(this_year_data)
            this_year_data = remove_except_numbers_dash_and_onward_no_space(this_year_data)
            this_year_data = remove_numeric_after_slash(this_year_data)
            this_year_data, is_2020 = check_string_for_20(this_year_data)
            if is_2020:
                mentioned_years.append('2020')
            for year in years:
                if str(year) in this_year_data:
                    mentioned_years.append('20'+str(year))
                    if "onward" in this_year_data:
                        today = datetime.date.today()
                        this_year = int(str(today.year)[-2:])
                        for elapsed_year in range(int(year)+1, this_year):
                            mentioned_years.append('20'+str(elapsed_year))
            if mentioned_years:
                mentioned_years = list(set(mentioned_years))
                if '-' in this_year_data:
                    mentioned_years = fill_in_years(mentioned_years)
                mentioned_years.sort()
                new_column_values.append(mentioned_years)
            else:
                new_column_values.append('')
        df['cleaned_'+column_name] = new_column_values
```
The `year_mapping` function processes and standardizes academic year data within a DataFrame, ensuring that year references are consistent and comprehensive across dataset entries. This function handles potentially fragmented or inconsistent year formats and normalizes them into a standardized list format.

#### Detailed Process Flow
1. **Initialize Year Range**:
   - Computes the current year and establishes a range of years from a starting year to a specified number of years into the future. This range is used to identify and parse year data within the dataset entries.

2. **Iterate Over Columns**:
   - The function iterates through each specified column that contains year data, applying transformation and mapping logic to each entry.

3. **Process Each Entry**:
   - For each entry in the column, it:
     - Handles known data errors explicitly, such as correcting specific typo errors.
     - Processes the text to extract year data, removing unwanted characters and formats through a series of helper functions (`process_colon`, `remove_except_numbers_dash_and_onward_no_space`, `remove_numeric_after_slash`).
     - Checks for and processes mentions of the year 2020 specifically, to ensure that 2020 is only extracted in correct contexts (e.g., 2019-20) and not in incorrect contexts (e.g., 2017-18).

4. **Identify and List Years**:
   - Identifies all year references in the processed text using the initialized year range.
   - Checks for textual markers like "onward" to infer continuous ranges and adjusts the list of years accordingly.
   - If a range is specified (e.g., "2018-2020"), it fills in the intervening years.

5. **Store Processed Years**:
   - Converts the list of mentioned years into a set and back to a list to remove duplicates, then sorts it.
   - Appends this list to a new column in the DataFrame specifically for cleaned year data, prefixed with 'cleaned_'.

6. **Logging and Debugging**:
   - For further traceability and maintenance, logging or debug statements could be added to track the transformations and catch any anomalies in the year data processing.

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**:
  - `df`: The pandas DataFrame containing the data to be processed.
  - `column_list`: A list of column names in the DataFrame that contain year information.
  - `year_start`: The starting year for generating the year range (default is 0).
  - `upto_future_year`: The number of years into the future to include in the year range beyond the current year (default is 5).

- **Outputs**:
  - The function modifies the DataFrame `df` in-place, adding new columns for each processed column containing the cleaned and standardized list of years. No return value is provided; the primary output is the modified DataFrame.

### `check_string_for_20` <a name="check-string-for-20-detailed"></a>
```python
def check_string_for_20(s):
    # Check if '2020' is a standalone year in the string
    if '2020' in s:
        return s.replace('20', ''), True

    # Find all occurrences of '20' in the string
    index = 0
    while index < len(s):
        index = s.find('20', index)
        if index == -1:
            break

        # Check if '20' is part of a 21st century year e.g., "2023", "2024-2025"
        if (index > 0 and s[index - 1].isdigit() and s[index + 2:index + 4].isdigit()):
            # Move past this occurrence
            index += 2
            continue

        # Check if '20' is after a '-' or standalone e.g., "20" or "2019-20" AND there is nothing after "20" or it's not a number
        if (index == 0 or s[index - 1] == '-') and (index + 2 >= len(s) or not s[index + 2].isdigit()):
            return s.replace('20', ''), True

        # Move to the next character to continue the search
        index += 1

    # If none of the conditions are met, return False
    return s.replace('20', ''), False
```
The `check_string_for_20` function is designed to analyze strings for occurrences of the substring "20", particularly to identify instances where it may represent the year "2020" or a shortened year format like "20" in contexts such as "2019-20". This function plays a crucial role in data preprocessing by ensuring that year references are identified and processed accurately.

#### Detailed Process Flow
1. **Initial Check for '2020'**:
   - The function first checks if '2020' is explicitly mentioned in the string. If found, it indicates that '2020' is likely referenced as a full year, and the string along with a flag `True` is returned after replacing occurrences of "20" to avoid duplicative processing.

2. **Search for '20' Substring**:
   - Iterates through the string to find occurrences of the substring "20". For each found instance, additional checks are performed to determine the context of its usage:
     - **Year Validation**: Ensures that '20' is part of a valid year representation by checking surrounding characters. If '20' is flanked by other digits (e.g., "2023" or in a range "2024-2025"), it skips further processing for that occurrence.
     - **Standalone or Range End**: If '20' appears at the start of the string or after a hyphen and is not followed by additional digits (suggesting a shortened year like "20" for "2020"), the function prepares to return with adjustments made to the string.

3. **Return Processed Data**:
   - Depending on the findings, the function returns the adjusted string and a Boolean flag:
     - **True**: If '20' is determined to represent a significant year reference (either "2020" or a shortened "20").
     - **False**: If no significant year usage is detected, indicating that '20' may appear in non-year contexts (like part of a number or word not related to dates).

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**:
  - `s`: A string potentially containing the substring '20' that needs to be checked for contextual significance as a year.

- **Outputs**:
  - Returns a tuple containing the modified string (with '20' removed in contexts where it represents a year) and a Boolean indicating whether '20' was found in a context that suggests it represents the year "2020". This helps in further data cleaning or transformation tasks where accurate year identification is crucial.

### `term_mapping` <a name="term-mapping-detailed"></a>
```python
def term_mapping(df, column_list):
    terms = ['sep', 'jan', 'may', 'jul']
    for column_name in column_list:
        for value_idx in range(len(list(df[column_name]))):
            mentioned_terms = []
            for term in terms:
                if term in str(df[column_name].iloc[value_idx]).lower():
                    mentioned_terms.append(term)
            if mentioned_terms:
                df[column_name].iloc[value_idx] = ','.join(mentioned_terms)
            else:
                df[column_name].iloc[value_idx] = ''
```
The `term_mapping` function is designed to identify and standardize academic term references within a DataFrame. It simplifies the representation of terms in the dataset by normalizing diverse term descriptions into a consistent format, facilitating easier analysis and comparison.

#### Detailed Process Flow
1. **Define Term Keywords**:
   - A list of term keywords (`terms`) is defined, representing typical academic terms such as "Sep", "Jan", "May", and "Jul". These keywords are used to search and identify term references within the dataset entries.

2. **Iterate Over Columns**:
   - The function iterates through each specified column that contains term information, applying the identification logic to each entry.

3. **Identify Terms in Entries**:
   - For each entry in a column:
     - The function initializes an empty list, `mentioned_terms`, to collect the terms identified within the entry.
     - It loops through each term in the predefined `terms` list, checking if the term is present in the entry (converted to lowercase for case insensitivity).
     - If a term is found, it is added to the `mentioned_terms` list.

4. **Update DataFrame Entries**:
   - After processing an entry:
     - If terms were identified (`mentioned_terms` is not empty), the entry in the DataFrame is updated to a comma-separated string of the terms, providing a clean and unified format.
     - If no terms are identified, the entry is set to an empty string, indicating the absence of term information.

5. **In-Place DataFrame Modification**:
   - The modifications (updating or clearing entries) are made directly in the DataFrame `df`, altering it in-place without the need for creating a new DataFrame. This method is efficient in terms of memory usage and execution time.

6. **Logging and Debugging**:
   - To enhance maintainability and facilitate troubleshooting, the function could be equipped with logging statements to log the process of term identification and any anomalies encountered. This is especially useful in large datasets or when updates to term definitions or formats are made.

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**:
  - `df`: The pandas DataFrame containing the data to be processed.
  - `column_list`: A list of column names in the DataFrame that are expected to contain term information.

- **Outputs**:
  - There is no return value; the function modifies the DataFrame `df` directly, updating it with cleaned and standardized term data. The main output is the enhanced clarity and uniformity in the representation of academic terms within the dataset.

### `ner_mapping` <a name="ner-mapping-detailed"></a>
```python
def ner_mapping(df, column, bucket, data_key, faculty_code_dict):
    df_institution_data = return_df(bucket, data_key)
    full_name_list = list(df_institution_data['PREFERRED_FULL_NAME'])
    department_list = list(df_institution_data['PRIMARY_DEPARTMENT_AFFILIATION'])
    faculty_list = list(df_institution_data['PRIMARY_FACULTY_AFFILIATION'])

    emails_list = list(df_institution_data['EMAIL_ADDRESS'])
    campus_list = list(df_institution_data['PRIMARY_CAMPUS_LOCATION'])
    
    source_data = df[column]
    destination_data = []
    
    for this_free_text_idx in range(len(source_data)):
        this_free_text = source_data.iloc[this_free_text_idx]
        if isinstance(this_free_text, str) and this_free_text != '': # only accepting valid strings
            associated_entities = retrieve_member_info(this_free_text)
            cleaned_associated_entities = add_institution_info(
                associated_entities,
                full_name_list,
                department_list,
                faculty_list,
                rank_list,
                emails_list,
                campus_list,
                faculty_code_dict
            )
            destination_data.append(cleaned_associated_entities)
        else:
            destination_data.append(this_free_text)
    df['cleaned_Team Members'] = destination_data
    return df
```
The `ner_mapping` function is essential for enriching dataset entries with structured and detailed information about entities (team members) identified within text data. It uses natural language processing to extract names, roles, and other pertinent details from unstructured text and maps these details to institutional data.

#### Detailed Process Flow
1. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Retrieves institutional data from an S3 bucket using the `return_df` function. This data includes lists of full names, department affiliations, faculty affiliations, academic ranks, email addresses, and campus locations.

2. **Initialize Processing Variables**:
   - Prepares lists from the retrieved institutional data, which will be used to match and enrich the identified entities.

3. **Iterate Over Data Entries**:
   - Processes each entry in the specified column of the DataFrame, ensuring that only valid (non-empty) strings are considered for entity extraction.

4. **Entity Extraction**:
   - For each valid text entry, the `retrieve_member_info` function is called to extract names, emails, and other entities using predefined patterns or NLP models.

5. **Enrich Extracted Data**:
   - Calls `add_institution_info` to map the extracted entity data to the corresponding institutional data based on matches found in names, emails, and other attributes. This function uses fuzzy matching to enhance the accuracy of data association, particularly useful in cases where exact matches are not possible.

6. **Store Enriched Data**:
   - Appends the enriched entity information to a list, which is then used to update the original DataFrame with a new column titled 'cleaned_Team Members', containing structured and detailed information about team members.

7. **Update DataFrame**:
   - The updated information is stored back in the DataFrame, replacing or appending to the existing data to reflect the enriched details accurately.

8. **Return Modified DataFrame**:
   - Returns the modified DataFrame, now enhanced with detailed entity information that can be directly used for further analysis or reporting.

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**:
  - `df`: The pandas DataFrame containing the data to be processed.
  - `column`: The name of the column in `df` that contains the text data from which entities will be extracted.
  - `bucket`: The name of the S3 bucket from where institutional data is retrieved.
  - `data_key`: The key within the S3 bucket that specifies the exact file or dataset to retrieve.
  - `faculty_code_dict`: A dictionary mapping faculty names to their respective codes, used to standardize faculty references in the output.

- **Outputs**:
  - The function returns the DataFrame `df` with an additional or updated column 'cleaned_Team Members', which includes enriched and structured data about entities identified and mapped from the text. This enhanced dataset facilitates deeper insights and more effective data utilization.

The `retrieve_member_info` function is instrumental in extracting and organizing entity information from text data, specifically targeting team member names, emails, and faculty affiliations within project descriptions or related text content. This function leverages both natural language processing via AWS Comprehend and fuzzy matching techniques to enhance data quality and relevance.

#### Detailed Process Flow
1. **Entity Detection**:
   - Utilizes the AWS Comprehend service to detect entities within the provided text, focusing on recognizing person names and email addresses as primary entities of interest.

2. **Faculty Mention Identification**:
   - Calls the `get_faculty` function to identify mentions of faculty within the text, which aids in associating detected person entities with specific faculties based on proximity.

3. **Initialize Collections**:
   - Prepares lists to hold names and emails extracted, alongside their positions in the text, to facilitate association and ensure that entities are matched correctly based on their appearances in the text.

4. **Fuzzy Matching for Association**:
   - Implements fuzzy matching logic to associate names with emails accurately. This step is crucial when direct one-to-one matches between names and emails are unclear, using similarity scores to find the best matches.
   - Adjusts remaining unassociated names or emails based on the outcomes of these associations.

5. **Faculty Association**:
   - Enhances the name-entity data with faculty information by matching the proximity of faculty mentions to the position of the name entity within the text.

6. **Return Structured Entity Data**:
   - Constructs and returns a dictionary containing the structured entity information, with keys as person names and values as dictionaries holding their respective email, faculty, and other relevant information.

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**:
  - `input_text`: A string containing the unstructured text from which entity information is to be extracted.

- **Outputs**:
  - Returns a dictionary where each key is a detected person name and each value is another dictionary containing attributes such as the team member's email, faculty, and any additional identified details. This output facilitates the enrichment of datasets with detailed and structured relational data about project participants.

The `get_faculty` function systematically scans a given text for mentions of predefined faculty names from a list associated with a particular institution, such as a university. It helps in identifying and extracting specific faculty affiliations from unstructured data, organizing them by their occurrence order in the text for further processing or analysis.

#### Detailed Process Flow
1. **Define Faculty Names**:
   - A list of predefined faculty names is established, representing the various faculties and departments within an institution. This list is comprehensive, covering common variations and names.

2. **Initialize Collection**:
   - Prepares a dictionary to store found faculties and their positions within the text, ensuring that each mention is captured accurately.

3. **Search and Identify Mentions**:
   - Iterates through each faculty name in the list and searches for its occurrence within the provided text:
     - **Case-insensitive search**: Converts both the input text and faculty names to lowercase to ensure the search is case-insensitive.
     - **Position tracking**: Records the start index of each mention, allowing for the sequential arrangement later.

4. **Order by Occurrence**:
   - Once all mentions are found and their positions recorded, the mentions are sorted based on their positions in the text. This sorting is crucial for maintaining the narrative or logical flow of faculty mentions when processing the text further.

5. **Return Ordered Faculty Mentions**:
   - Converts the sorted dictionary of faculty mentions into an ordered dictionary to maintain the sequence of mentions. This ordered list is then returned for use in further data processing steps.

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**:
  - `input_text`: The string from which faculty mentions need to be extracted. This could be a description, a list of affiliations, or any other form of textual data where faculty names might appear.

- **Outputs**:
  - Returns an `OrderedDict` where each key is the position of a faculty mention in the text and each value is the corresponding faculty name. This structured output is particularly useful for subsequent data enrichment, where maintaining the order of mentions is necessary to preserve contextual integrity.
